# Hospital-Management-Database---DS5110

Hospital Management Database (with other characteristics)

## Goal of our project
...

## Requirements and Dependencies

This project requires Python 3.8+ and MySQL 8.0+. The following Python libraries are required:

### Data Generation
- `faker` - For generating synthetic personal information
- `transformers` - For creating realistic doctor notes using pre-trained language models
- `torch` - PyTorch framework for transformer models

### Data Processing
- `pandas` - Data manipulation and analysis
- `numpy` - Numerical computing

### Database
- `sqlalchemy` - To connect to your local MySQL database

### Predictive Modeling
- `scikit-learn` - Machine learning algorithms
- `statsmodels` - Statistical modeling and hypothesis testing
- `pmdarima` - Auto ARIMA time series forecasting

### Visualization
- `matplotlib` - Creating static visualizations
- `seaborn` - Statistical data visualization

### Standard Libraries
- `random` - Random number generation
- `re` - Regular expressions
- `pathlib` - File system path operations
- `datetime` - Date and time handling

### Installation

Install all required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install faker transformers torch pandas numpy scikit-learn statsmodels pmdarima matplotlib seaborn sqlalchemy
```

Or use the requirements.txt file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run Our Code

1. **Generate the synthetic dataset**: Run the `Main Code for Hospital Database - Final Project - Churou Deng & Sumedha Rajesh.ipynb` file to create your own synthetic dataset with CSV files. It should be noticed that generating 200 doctor notes will take around **4 hours**, and if you are using Google Colab, please run `Doctor_note_generator_for_Final_Project.ipynb` instead, in case the notebook crashes because of cache limits.
  - If you do not want to generate your own data files, a copy of each generated file is located in \data in our GitHub Repository.
 
2. **Install MySQL**: Download and install MySQL 8.0 from the official website: [https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/]

3. **Build the database schema**: In MySQL Workbench or Shell, execute the `hospitaldb_generation.sql` script to construct the hospitaldb database framework.

4. **Import the data**: Load all the generated CSV files from step 1 into the hospitaldb database tables you created in step 3.

5. **Visualize the data**: Run the `Visualizations for Final Project.ipynb` notebook to create visualizations from your newly created dataset. (If you are running the visualizations in Google Colab, you must load all of the .csv files generated from the `Main Code for Hospital Database - Final Project - Churou Deng & Sumedha Rajesh.ipynb` file into the Visualizations Google Colab file before running it. Otherwise you can simply run the `Visualizations for Final Project.ipynb` notebook in (VS Code) to create visualizations from your newly created dataset.)

## Our Approach/Methodology
Current hospital management database systems have many setbacks and inefficiencies and are unsuitable for current hospital staff for multiple reasons. The reasons we wish to address with our new database design are the lack of interoperability, poor data quality, structural issues, and poor analytical capability. We would like to create a data management system that combines multiple data streams into one location, as many staff members currently complain about different systems not translating well across each other. We would also like data to be easier to search, analyze, extract, and trust. We aim to do this by creating a data management system that allows efficient data storage and important metrics to be easily obtained, extrapolated, and converted into meaningful visuals. This hospital management database is designed to streamline healthcare operations by integrating multiple data streams into a unified, cohesive system that captures the complete patient journey from registration through appointments, treatments, lab work, and billing. The structure is defined in our entity relationship diagram linked below.
